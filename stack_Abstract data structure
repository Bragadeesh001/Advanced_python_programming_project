STACK - Abstract Data Structure - implementation using basic python + OOP

1. The name stack data structure resembles a pile of objects, stack of papers, or a tower of blocks, where
    adding and removing of items occur only at the top of the pile.
2. A stack an abstract linear data type. collection of objects that supports fast last=in, first-out (LIFO)
    semantics for iinserts and deletes
3. Unlike lists or arrays, stacks typically dont allow for random access to the objects they contain.
4. The insert and delete operations are also often called push and pop operations
5. Stacks and Queues are both linear collections of items.
    a. However, in a queue the least recently added item is removed first, following the First in First Out or FIFO
    b. On the other hand in a stack the most recently added item is removed in the begining following, following the LIFO


A real-life example of a stack is a pile of heavy and precious plates, all kept on top of the other. If you wish to add a plate or 
remove one , you can do that only from the top. However, if you wish to remove a lower plate from the stack, you have to remove the topmost plates one by one, in order to
